# Demystifying_Databases_Part_1

Demo code to accompany my talk "Demystfying Databases by Building One." first given to the Geneva DNUG: https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Geneva-NET-User-Group/events/262061845/

A link to the slides will be added here at a later date.

Before running the demos, you will need to grab the compressed test data from my Dropbox here: https://www.dropbox.com/home/Demystifying_Databases
Unzip the archive to a solution, root level directory named .\Data

Some known issues are acknowledged here: Database.Interactive/TODO.txt
