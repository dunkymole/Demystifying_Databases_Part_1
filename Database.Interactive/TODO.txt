1. we need to roll back the current transaction when a unique check constraint fails
2. we need transactions more generally
3. a nice solution for composite keys (c# type system is making life hard)
4. other join types
5. make querying more composable
6. a more complete query analyser (current method of querying forces the query writer to specify the index)
